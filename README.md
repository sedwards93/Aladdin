# Aladdin üßû‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

A stunning frontend JavaScript testing framework designed to be used in the browser. With syntax eerily similar to Jasmine, your switch to Aladdin will be seamless! Who needs more than two matchers anyway?! Lightweight and fun, Aladdin is the perfect counterpart to JavaScript's boring and established testing frameworks.
